* 1.1.2

- Fix issues with schemaless uri (ex: `//foo.com`)

* 1.1.1

Now only fetch partial image data to compute its size and type.

Thanks to [vdaubry](https://github.com/vdaubry) the gem now uses typhoeus
stream capability to fetch images and get its size and type, aborting the
request if necessary. Make sure to use typhoeus `>= 0.7.3` in order to benefit
from this update since there was an issue with previous typhoeus version when
aborting ongoing requests.
